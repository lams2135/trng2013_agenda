This is Lams's ss_trng_2013 (Agenda)

My repo includes a unit test, any can download it for testing.
Stage-2 source is now avaliable.

If u only want to test your codes, replace src with your codes,
then run the commands below :
$ cd test
$ make run

To check cpplint, you can run cpplint.sh with [class name]
(eg. AgendaService.cpp) :
$ cd test
$ ./cpplint.sh AgendaService

By the way ---
    Stage-3 is comming.

Special thanks to Idiot Chuang.

Wish a good day.
